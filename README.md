# Integration-Using-Simpson-s-1-3-Rule-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of Simpson's 1/3 Rule for numerical integration. The code estimates the integral of a given function \( f(x) \) within specified limits using Simpson's 1/3 Rule, a method for approximating the definite integral of a function.
